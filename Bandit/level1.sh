# level 1 --> level 2
# The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

#username: bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
#password: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

# - is as mentioned in the question is a file. It is a dashed file name.
# File/folder names starting with - might cause problems with many commands as - are used to introduce command \n
# line arguments or flags (-f, -r). If you are curious execute the command "cat -". You won't see anything because the \n
# system is waiting for the arguments/flags. 

#  to read dashed files, use:
more -
#copy the password to ssh into your next bandit level
# use the "exit" command to exit bandit1

# Happy Hacking!
