# The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. \n
# For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the \n
# next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
