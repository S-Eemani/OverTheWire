## Level 4 â†’ Level 5

### Objective:
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the `inhere` directory. If your terminal is messed up, try the `reset` command.

### SSH Credentials for Level 4:
- **Username**: `bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- **Password**: `2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ`

### Steps:

1. First, list the contents of the current directory:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```

2. Change to the `inhere` directory:
    ```bash
    cd inhere
    ```

3. Use the `find` command to search for files and determine which one is human-readable:
    ```bash
    find -type f | xargs file
    ```
   - `find -type f`: Searches for files in the current directory.
   - `|`: Pipes the output of the `find` command to the next command.
   - `xargs file`: Takes the list of files generated by the `find` command and passes them as arguments to the `file` command, which determines the file type (text file, binary, image, etc.).

4. Identify the human-readable file, which will be listed as `ASCII text` (in this case, `./-file07`).

5. To display the contents of the dashed file, use:
    ```bash
    cat < -file07
    ```

Copy the password displayed and use it to log into the next level (`bandit5`) via SSH

### Happy Hacking!
